				<h2>About This Project</h2>
				<p>After a recent <a href="https://events.indieweb.org/2020/09/online-homebrew-website-club-europe-london-TDLtXJn3Febu">Homebrew Website Club meeting</a>, jamesgoca started to think about what he could do with his Raspberry Pi. Inspired by the Raspberry Pi Weather Station projects, he has created this live website that shows the weather in his current location and the environmental conditions in his bedroom where he works.</p>
