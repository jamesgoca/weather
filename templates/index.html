	<h2>About This Project</h2>
	<p>After a recent <a href="https://events.indieweb.org/2020/09/online-homebrew-website-club-europe-london-TDLtXJn3Febu">Homebrew Website Club meeting</a>, jamesgoca started to think about what he could do with his Raspberry Pi. Inspired by the Raspberry Pi Weather Station projects, he has created this live website that shows the weather in his current location and the environmental conditions in his bedroom where he works.</p>
	<p>The background color of this page changes depending on the weather. The states supported are:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>Dark Blue: Two degrees or under.</li>
		<li>Blue: Between three and eight degrees.</li>
		<li>Yellow: Between nine and 15 degrees.</li>
		<li>Orange: 16 degrees and over.</li>
	</ul>
